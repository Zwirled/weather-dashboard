# Weather Dashboard

## Description
Week 08: Challenge 08 â€“ Weather Dashboard

This is a web application that uses the Open Weather Map API to retrieve weather data for a given city. When the user inputs a city and clicks the search button, the code will retrieve the weather forecast for that city. It displays a history of all previously searched locations as buttons, which can be clicked to retrieve the same weather data again. A handy web application for travellers who need a place to collate weather information for multiple cities at once.
